## What This Is

**It bulk downloads images from Konachan.com and Yande.re with high speed.**

KonaDL CLI is a standalone application that uses libkonadl to bulk download images from konachan.com / konachan.net / yande.re. It provides better user interface comparing to libkonadl, but it cannot be used as a library.

libkonadl is a library that helps you bulk downloading images according to ratings (Safe/Questionable/Explicit) from konachan.com / konachan.net / yande.re with multithreading. It can also run as a standalone program that can run directly on any platform that supports python (at least according to the current design).

Just thought it would be fun to have an EULA.
